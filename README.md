# PHP-Web-tool
For my final MSC project, I was required to create a tool that would allow students to select a project which would then assign them to a group based on their first or second selection.

The tool had the following parameters:
- operating in sessions so if the student exited the page an entirely new session would start again and any info submitted to the database would be deleted after a particular time frame.
- students would be required to use the randomly generated code sent to their email address to confirm their choice. If the process wasn't completed in the time allotted, any information    regarding the student and the selection would be erased from the database and the student would be required to start the process again
- The hope was that the tool would create a time-effective selection process that would allow students to sign onto their first or second choice of projects and subsequently be assigned     a group at which point they would receive the relevant documentation based on the assignment.
